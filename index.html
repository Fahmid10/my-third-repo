    <h1>Classification of memory</h1>
    <p>A computer system contains a variety of memory devices to store instruction and data for its operation. In general, memory components of a computer system can be divided into three categories:</p>
    <li>Internal processor memory (or built-in memory)</li>
    <li>Main memory or primary memory</li>
    <li>Secondary memory</li>
    <p><b>Internal Processor Memory: </b>Basically it comprises of a small set of high-speed register used as a working memory for temporary storage of instruction and data. Some microprocessor also employ another type of built-in memory called cache.</p>
    <p><b>Main memory: </b>It is relatively a large memory. This memory is used for program and data storage during computer operation. Location in memory can be accessed directly an rapidly by the CPU.</p>
    <p><b>Secondary Memory: </b>This is generally much larger in capacity but is slower than main memory. It is used for storing system programs and large dat file, which are not continually required by the CPU.</p>

        <h1>General Properties of Memory Devices</h1>
        <p>Memories are based on a number of physical phenomenon and principles. Knowledge of these properties is essential in evaluating memory technologies.</p>
